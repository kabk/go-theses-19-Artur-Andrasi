Where not only the subject and the content matters but the style, the mood and the tools used as well. These significant details create the identity of an artwork, and I believe that this identity is just as important as the message itself, as the tone and the style will define the audience/target of the work. Therefore, finding the right identity is a cardinal question in the process of making an artwork. How can I find the appropriate style and identity for my work? What does that communicate? How does it affect the viewer? And how can I manipulate and control the mood of the audience?</p></a>

It is focused on the measurement of traits, which can define our behaviour, thoughts and emotions. Comparing with type-based models (such as Psychological Types by Carl Gustav Jung or Myers-Briggs Type Indicator by Katharine Cook Briggs), in which traits are something a person has or does not have, trait-based models traits have dimensions, for example, introversion and extroversion. In trait-based models, there are no types but a spectrum on which anyone can rate somewhere along.</p></a>

I will introduce the theory of personality types by the Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Gustav Jung as the origin of this subject. To have a more contemporary point of view about these studies I will use the book “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking” by Susan Cain, an American writer and lecturer.

These guides will help me to get to a conclusion and reflect on my own art and working method, helping me to be able to build and create a specific atmosphere/identity in my future artworks.

Galen&nbsp; described people based on the four temperaments (sanguine, choleric, melancholic, and phlegmatic), but in the evolution of psychology, scientists have been driven to fit the variables and complexities of human personality into well-defined models. Although it is a very complex task to categorize people and understand they needs and acts, the current models account for our most important personality traits and can predict our behaviour with a high degree of accuracy.</p><p>There are many comprehensive models of personality which include these in different forms: the Big Five model, Hans Eysenck's three-factor model and Raymond Cattell's 16 personality factors. The first person who created the concept of introversion and extroversion was the famous Swiss psychologist, Carl Gustav Jung.&nbsp; Since the concept was born the definition of introversion and extroversion has been changed and shaped by the years. In this chapter, I will introduce the most famous and widely accepted theories by psychologists and scientists in order to understand and create my own definition of introverts.</p></a>

     <a class="nonblock nontext anim_swing ts01-Arial clearfix grpelem" id="u1210-7" href="artur_sketch_1.html#jung2"><!-- content --><p>The book, Psychological Types by Carl Gustav Jung, published in 1921, includes the theory of introverts-extroverts. Jung theorizes that each person falls into a category, either introversion or extroversion. According to him, the two mutually exclusive attitudes are the core of our personality. The main difference is the energy acquisition, “Each person seems to be energized more by either the external world (extraversion) or the internal world (introversion).”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He compares these types to ancient archetypes, Dionysus and Apollo. An extrovert is linked to Dionysus, who actively involved in the world of people. An extrovert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensual perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extrovert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. An introvert is associated with Apollo, who shines a light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. They are more comfortable living alone and being themselves. They are also getting easily tired after or meantime big social activities, therefore they depend more on me-time to recharge. They also tend to be introspective and keep their social circle limited.</p></a>

     <a class="nonblock nontext anim_swing ts01-Arial clearfix grpelem" id="u1219-4" href="artur_sketch_1.html#jung3"><!-- content --><p>Jung observes that none of us is completely extroverted or introverted, but we certainly connect to one or the other attitude. In all of us, lies an unconscious mind, which is not conscious of feelings and thoughts all the time, but those feelings and thoughts can affect our lives nonetheless. “If you take an extrovert you will find his unconscious has an introverted quality because all the extraverted qualities are played out in his consciousness and the introverted are left in the unconscious.” It means if extroverts could control when and how to bring their introvert personality to the front, and as well, introverts could enlarge their extroversion, then they could have more command over their mental space.&nbsp; Since both personalities have a downside, both could benefit from the other. An extrovert depends more on the environment, needs external impulses. But in life, we all have situations when we need more me time to find a solution to our problems. The same with introverts, they depend more on their own thoughts and feelings, which could generate a cage, isolating them from the outside world. If they could consciously work on switching and emphasizing their extrovert qualities and decide to speak with someone about their problems, the might solve the situation.</p></a>
     <a class="nonblock nontext anim_swing ts01-Arial clearfix grpelem" id="u1225-4" href="artur_sketch_1.html#jung4"><!-- content --><p>Jung said that we all think, feel, sense and experience the world in many different ways. He identified four essential psychological functions: thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition. Each function may be experienced in an introverted or an extroverted way, and one of these functions is more dominant in each one of us. One depends on thinking and feeling rather than sensing and intuiting.</p></a>

Even though he built a good base, the popular understanding and psychological usage differ from his original intent today. Jung’s theory has limitations, such as categorizing people whose values are close to the middle range of the scale. These people are not, extroverts nor introverts: they are in between. This is a general problem with type-based theories even if the scale of the category is 4,8,16 or 32. Identifying and analysing black and white is great, but the grey zone between is blurry. Therefore psychologists developed different methodologies called trait-based rather than a type-based model.</p></a>

The essence of the theory group is that they can be classified into five-factor groups according to the factor-analytic order of different personality features.&nbsp; Big Five personality taxonomy was introduced in the 1950s by Warren Norman. The five personality traits of the Big Five are openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism, extraversion. Each of the traits contains two separate, but correlated, aspects reflecting a level of personality, opposite statements are shown to determinate which statement is relevant according to the person and how accurate it is to his/her personality.</p></a>
