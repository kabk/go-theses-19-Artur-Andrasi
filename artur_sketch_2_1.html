     <p><span class="Character-Style">01 Introduction</span></p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><span class="Character-Style">Being an introvert is something that really defines me. It is part of my personality.&nbsp; It’s not necessarily the core but it definitely influences my everyday life, my friendships, network or working method. If it has such a big impact on me, I believe that it’s important to understand it in more depth. Although this sounds like a truly personal motivation, the aim of this research is not to unravel my identity, but to be able to gain a tool/working method through a more general psychological research.</span></p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><span class="Character-Style">I have always been interested in how the creator’s personality influences the artworks. Since I was a kid, I’ve always unconsciously tried to imagine the artist itself based on the artwork; is s/he old, young, talkative, quiet, rigorous or playful etc. I believe that most people try to imagine the personality of their ‘heroes’ – whether those ‘heroes’ are teachers, bosses, celebrities or artists.&nbsp; Our behaviour describes ourselves, says the Hungarian proverb, but how much an artwork can actually tell about the artist? Does the artwork have a personality or is it just a simple and straightforward reflection on the artists?</span></p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Visual language is communication. Where not only the subject and the content matters but the style, the mood and the tools used as well. These significant details create the identity of an artwork, and I believe that this identity is just as important as the message itself, as the tone and the style will define the audience/target of the work. Therefore, finding the right identity is a cardinal question in the process of making an artwork. How can I find the appropriate style and identity for my work? What does that communicate? How does it affect the viewer? And how can I manipulate and control the mood of the audience?</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>In my thesis, I will try to answer the questions mentioned above. My aim is to understand introversion as a type of personality, and taking that as a starting point to create an analytic system to examine artworks and the visual language. Therefore, in the first chapter, I will focus on the theoretical aspect, providing a definition of introversion, in comparison with extraversion. I will introduce the theory of personality types by the Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Gustav Jung as the origin of this subject. To have a more contemporary point of view about these studies I will use the book “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking” by Susan Cain, an American writer and lecturer. At the end of that chapter, I’ll introduce my own definition as a conclusion.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>In the second chapter, I’ll analyse several artworks (such as Donald Schenkel’s paintings; Wellness: short movie, the movie Youth, Netflix Cover Generator, Urban Island by Eva Czaya etc.) to understand the way they represent introversion in their artwork and analyse the tools they are using to create their “identity”. These guides will help me to get to a conclusion and reflect on my own art and working method, helping me to be able to build and create a specific atmosphere/identity in my future artworks. Studying these tools, the awareness of what effect it has on the audience, and using them consciously will help me to reach my target group and communicate my message in a more sufficient way.</p>

          <p>02 First Chapter | Defining Introversion</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When it comes to the term ‘introvert’ the Cambridge Dictionary defines it as “Someone who is shy, quiet, and prefers to spend time alone rather than often being with other people.”</p>
          <p>It is probably the most common definition anyone would give, which is an easy and appropriate description regarding everyday life, but it doesn’t give an in depth explanation and reflects only on the symptoms of introversion, not the reasons behind it.</p>
          <p>Personality refers to an individual’s pattern of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that make a person unique.&nbsp; Since the beginning of time, humans tried to describe and categorize personalities. Galen&nbsp; described people based on the four temperaments (sanguine, choleric, melancholic, and phlegmatic), but in the evolution of psychology, scientists have been driven to fit the variables and complexities of human personality into well-defined models. Although it is a very complex task to categorize people and understand they needs and acts, the current models account for our most important personality traits and can predict our behaviour with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
          <p>There are many comprehensive models of personality which include these in different forms: the Big Five model, Hans Eysenck's three-factor model and Raymond Cattell's 16 personality factors. The first person who created the concept of introversion and extroversion was the famous Swiss psychologist, Carl Gustav Jung.&nbsp; Since the concept was born the definition of introversion and extroversion has been changed and shaped by the years. In this chapter, I will introduce the most famous and widely accepted theories by psychologists and scientists in order to understand and create my own definition of introverts.</p>

          <p>02.1 Psychological Types - Carl Gustav Jung</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To explore this subject, it’s worth starting with the theory of Carl Gustav Jung, who was one of the first to create this psychological phrase. Even though the popular understanding and psychological usage nowadays differs from how he originally intended, still many contemporary studies refer to his theory.</p>
          <p>The book, Psychological Types by Carl Gustav Jung, published in 1921, includes the theory of introverts-extroverts. Jung theorizes that each person falls into a category, either introversion or extroversion. According to him, the two mutually exclusive attitudes are the core of our personality. The main difference is the energy acquisition, “Each person seems to be energized more by either the external world (extraversion) or the internal world (introversion).”</p>
          <p>He compares these types to ancient archetypes, Dionysus and Apollo. An extrovert is linked to Dionysus, who actively involved in the world of people. An extrovert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensual perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extrovert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. An introvert is associated with Apollo, who shines a light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. They are more comfortable living alone and being themselves. They are also getting easily tired after or meantime big social activities, therefore they depend more on me-time to recharge. They also tend to be introspective and keep their social circle limited.</p>
          <p>Jung observes that none of us is completely extroverted or introverted, but we certainly connect to one or the other attitude. In all of us, lies an unconscious mind, which is not conscious of feelings and thoughts all the time, but those feelings and thoughts can affect our lives nonetheless. “If you take an extrovert you will find his unconscious has an introverted quality because all the extraverted qualities are played out in his consciousness and the introverted are left in the unconscious.” It means if extroverts could control when and how to</p>
          <p>bring their introvert personality to the front, and as well, introverts could enlarge their extroversion, then they could have more command over their mental space.&nbsp; Since both personalities have a downside, both could benefit from the other. An extrovert depends more on the environment, needs external impulses. But in life, we all have situations when we need more me time to find a solution to our problems. The same with introverts, they depend more on their own thoughts and feelings, which could generate a cage, isolating them from the outside world. If they could consciously work on switching and emphasizing their extrovert qualities and decide to speak with someone about their problems, the might solve the situation.</p>
          <p>Jung said that we all think, feel, sense and experience the world in many different ways. He identified four essential psychological functions: thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition. Each function may be experienced in an introverted or an extroverted way, and one of these functions is more dominant in each one of us. One depends on thinking and feeling rather than sensing and intuiting.</p>
          <p>Carl Gustav Jung and his theory, Psychological Types is a definitive work and has a big impact on the later psychologists. Even though he built a good base, the popular understanding and psychological usage differ from his original intent today. Jung’s theory has limitations, such as categorizing people whose values are close to the middle range of the scale. These people are not, extroverts nor introverts: they are in between. This is a general problem with type-based theories even if the scale of the category is 4,8,16 or 32. Identifying and analysing black and white is great, but the grey zone between is blurry. Therefore psychologists developed different methodologies called trait-based rather than a type-based model.</p>

         <p>02..2 Big Five personality traits</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>Trait theory is an approach to study human personality. It is focused on the measurement of traits, which can define our behaviour, thoughts and emotions. Comparing with type-based models (such as Psychological Types by Carl Gustav Jung or Myers-Briggs Type Indicator by Katharine Cook Briggs), in which traits are something a person has or does not have, trait-based models traits have dimensions, for example, introversion and extroversion. In trait-based models, there are no types but a spectrum on which anyone can rate somewhere along.</p>
         <p>Big-Five (also known as the five-factor model (FFM), and the OCEAN model,) is probably the most popular and widely accepted taxonomy for personality traits. The essence of the theory group is that they can be classified into five-factor groups according to the factor-analytic order of different personality features.&nbsp; Big Five personality taxonomy was introduced in the 1950s by Warren Norman. The five personality traits of the Big Five are openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism, extraversion. Each of the traits contains two separate, but correlated, aspects reflecting a level of personality, opposite statements are shown to determinate which statement is relevant according to the person and how accurate it is to his/her personality.</p>

    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-2">Openness to experience: This trait explores how much people are mentally interested, open to emotion, sensitive to beauty, and willing to try new things. On the one end of the dimension, people are usually more creative and sensitive to their feelings than those who are locked and opened for art, culture, emotions, adventures, and general curiosity. They are more likely to have unconventional convictions.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-4">o I have excellent ideas.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-6">o I am quick to understand things.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-8">o I use difficult words.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-10">o I am full of ideas.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-12">o I am interested in abstractions.</p>

    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-17">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-19">Conscientiousness: Conscience tends to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and strive to achieve measures or external expectations. This is related to how people control their impulses. The highest scores of conscience indicate the intended rather than the spontaneous behaviour preference. The average level of conscience increases among young adults and then decreases among older adults.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-21">o I always am prepared.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-23">o I pay attention to details.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-25">o I get chores done right away.</p>

    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-40">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-42">Agreeableness: The friendship factor is usually referred to as the ability to maintain relationships. Some say that there is a kind of obedient service, care and emotional support that requires negating negative feelings. At the other end of the dimension, it refers to the discomfort, the opposing or the opposite, which can go to hostility.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-44">o I am interested in people.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-46">o I sympathize with others' feelings.</p>

    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-58">o I insult people.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-60">o I am not interested in other people's problems.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-62">o I feel little concern for others.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-63">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-65">Neuroticism: Neuroticism is the tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, or depression. Anxiety balance is perhaps the most important contrast of the factor, but the term itself covers a lot of the factor itself. The person at one end of the dimension: emotionally balanced, able to face stressful situations smoothly. The person at the other end of the dimension: prone to unrealistic thinking, low self-esteem, somatic symptoms, less able to control impulses.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-67">o I get irritated easily.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-69">o I get stressed out easily.</p>

    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-83">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-85">Extraversion: Trait, which shows activity, social skills and the source of energy. Extravert enjoys the interaction between people and often feel they are full of energy. They are usually living, action-oriented individuals. They have high group visibility, they are the centre of the conversation.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-87">Generally, people are a combination of extraversion and introversion, with personality psychologist Eysenck suggesting that these traits are connected somehow to our central nervous system.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-89">o I am the life of the party.</p>
    <p class="ts04-Adamina" id="u1430-91">o I don't mind being the centre of attention.</p>
